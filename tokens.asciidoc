== Tokens

=== What are tokens?

The word _token_ derives from the Old English "tacen" meaning a sign or symbol. Commonly used to mean privately-issued coin-like items that have insignificant value, as used in transportation tokens, laundry tokens, arcade tokens.

Nowadays, tokens based on blockchains are redefining the word to mean blockchain-based abstractions that can be owned and that represent assets, currency, or access rights.

The association between the word "token" and insignificant value has a lot to do with the limited use of physical tokens. Often restricted to specific businesses, organizations or locations, physical tokens are not easily exchangeable and cannot be used for more than one function. With blockchain tokens, these restrictions are erased. Many of these tokens serve multiple purposes, globally and can be traded for each other or for other currencies in global liquid markets. With those restrictions gone, the "insignificant value" expectation is also a thing of the past.

In this section we look at various uses for tokens and how they are created. We also discuss attributes of tokens such as fungibility and intrinsicality. Finally, we examine the standards and technologies that they are based on and experiment by building our own tokens.

=== How are tokens used?

The most obvious use of tokens is as digital private currencies. However, this is only one possible use. Tokens can be programmed to serve many different functions, often overlapping. For example, a token can simultaneously convey a voting right, an access right and ownership of a resource. Currency is just the first "app".

Currency:: A token can serve as a form of currency, with a value determined through private trade. For example, ether or bitcoin.

Resource:: A token can represent a resource earned or produced in a sharing-economy or resource-sharing environment. For example, a storage or CPU token representing resources that can be shared over a network.

Asset:: A token can represent ownership of an intrinsic or extrinsic, tangible or intangible asset. For example, gold, real-estate, a car, oil, energy etc.

Access:: A token can represent access rights and even convey access to a digital or physical property, such as a discussion forum, an exclusive website, a hotel room, a rental car.

Equity:: A token can represent shareholder equity in a digital organization (e.g. a DAO) or legal fiction (e.g. a corporation)

Voting:: A token can represent voting rights in a digital or legal system.

Collectible:: A token can represent a digital (e.g. CryptoPunks) or physical collectible (e.g. a painting)

Identity:: A token can represent a digital (e.g. avatar) or legal identity (e.g. national ID).

Attestation:: A token can represent a certification or attestation of fact by some authority or by a decentralized reputation system.

Often, a single token has several of these functions overlapping. In some cases it is hard to discern between them, as the physical equivalents have always been inextricably linked. For example, in the physical world, a driver's license (attestation) is also an identity document (identity) and the two cannot be separated. In the digital realm, previously commingled functions can be separated and developed independently (e.g. an anonymous attestation).

=== Tokens and fungibility

From Wikipedia:

 In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable.

Tokens are fungible when we can substitute any single unit of the token for another without any difference in its value or function. For example, ether is a fungible token, as any unit of ether has the same value and use as any other unit of ether.

Strictly speaking, if a token's historical provenance can be tracked, then it is not entirely fungible. The ability to track provenance can lead to blacklisting and whitelisting, reducing or eliminating fungibility. We will examine this further in <<privacy>>.

Non-fungible tokens are tokens that each represent a unique tangible or intangible item and therefore are not interchangeable. For example, a token that represents ownership of a _specific_ Van Gogh painting is not equivalent to another token that represents a Picasso. Similarly, a token representing a _specific_ digital collectible such as a specific CryptoKitty (see <<cryptoKitties>>) is not interchangeable with any other CryptoKitty.

We will see examples of both fungible and non-fungible tokens later in this section.

=== Counterparty risk

Counterparty risk is the risk that the _other_ party in a transaction will fail to meet their obligations. Some types of transactions create additional counterparty risks because of the addition of more than two parties in the transaction. For example, if you hold a certificate of deposit for a precious metal and you sell that to someone, there are at least 3 parties in that transaction: the seller, the buyer and the custodian of the precious metal. Someone holds the physical asset and by necessity they become a party to, and add counterparty risk, to any transaction involving that asset. When any asset is traded indirectly through the exchange of a token of ownership, there is additional counterparty risk from the custodian of the asset. Do they have the asset? Will they recognize (or allow) the transfer of ownership based on the transfer of a token (such as a certificate, deed, title or digital token). In the world of digital tokens, it is important to understand who holds the asset that is represented by the token and what rules apply to that underlying asset.

=== Tokens and intrinsicality

The word "intrinsic" derives from the Latin "intra", meaning "from within".

Some tokens represent digital items that are _intrinsic_ to the blockchain. Those digital assets are governed by consensus rules, just like the tokens themselves. This has an important implication: tokens that represent intrinsic assets do not carry additional counterparty risk. If you hold the keys to 1 ether, there is no other party holding that ether for you. The blockchain consensus rules apply and your ownership (control) of the private keys is equivalent to ownership of the asset, without any intermediary.

Conversely, many tokens are used to represent _extrinsic_ things, like real-estate, corporate voting shares, trademarks, gold bars. The ownership of these items, which are not "within" the blockchain are governed by law, custom and policy that are separate from the consensus rules that govern the token. As a result, these extrinsic assets carry additional counterparty risk because they are held by custodians, recorded in external registries, or controlled by laws and policies outside the blockchain environment.

One of the most important ramifications of blockchain-based tokens is the ability to replace extrinsic assets into intrinsic assets and thereby remove counterparty risk. A good example is moving from equity in a corporation (extrinsic) to a equity or voting token in a _decentralized autonomous organization_ or similar (intrinsic) organization.

=== Using tokens: utility or equity

Almost all projects in Ethereum today are launching with some kind of token. But do all these projects really need a token? Are there any disadvantages to using a token, or will we see the slogan "tokenize all the things" come to fruition?

First, let's start by clarifying the role of a token in a new project. The majority of projects are using tokens in one of two ways: either as "utility tokens" or as "equity tokens". Very often, those two roles are conflated and difficult to distinguish.

Utility tokens are those where use of the token is required to pay for use of a service, application or resource. Examples of utility tokens include tokens that represent resources such as shared storage, access to services such as social media networks, or ether itself as gas for the Ethereum platform. By comparison, equity tokens are those that represent shares in a startup.

Equity tokens can be as limited as non-voting shares for distribution of dividends and profits, or as expansive as voting shares in a decentralized-autonomous-organization, where management of the platform is through majority votes by the token holders.

==== It's not a duck

Just because a token is used to fundraise for a startup, doesn't mean it has to be used as payment for the service, and vice-versa. Many startups, however face a difficult problem: tokens are a great fundraising mechanism, but offering securities (equity) to the public is a regulated activity in most jurisdictions. By disguising equity tokens as utility tokens, many startups hope to get around these regulatory restrictions and raise money from a public offering while presenting it as a pre-sale of a utility token. Whether these thinly disguised equity offerings will be able to skirt the regulators remains to be seen.

As the popular saying goes: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - it's a duck". Regulators are not likely to be distracted by these semantic contortions, quite the opposite, they are more likely to see such legal sophistry as an attempt to deceive the public.


==== Utility tokens: who needs them?

The real problem however is that utility tokens introduce significant risks and adoption barriers for startups. Perhaps in a distant future "tokenize all the things" becomes a reality. But, at present, the number of people who have access to, understanding, and desire to use a token is a subset of the already small cryptocurrency market.

For a startup, each innovation represents a risk and a market filter. Innovation is taking the road least traveled, walking away from the path of tradition. It is already a lonely walk. If a startup is trying to innovate in a new area of technology, such as storage sharing over P2P networks, that is a lonely enough path. Adding a utility token to that innovation and requiring users to adopt tokens in order to use the service compounds the risk and increases the barriers to adoption. It's walking off the already lonely trail of P2P storage innovation and into the wilderness.

Think of each innovation as a filter. It limits adoption to the subset of the market that can become early adopters of this innovation. Adding a second filter compounds that effect, further limiting the addressable market. You are asking your early adopters to adopt not one but two completely new technologies: the novel application/platform/service you built, and the token economy.

For a startup, each innovation introduces risks that increase the chance of failure of the startup. If you take your already risky startup idea and add a utility token, you are adding all the risks of the underlying platform (Ethereum), broader economy (exchanges, liquidity), regulatory environment (equity/commodity regulators) and technology (smart contracts, token standards). That's a lot of risk for a startup.

Advocates of "tokenize all the things" will likely counter that by adopting tokens, they are also inheriting the market enthusiasm, early adopters, technology, innovation and liquidity of the entire token economy. That is true too. The question is whether the benefits and enthusiasm outweigh the risks and uncertainties.

Finally, at the beginning of this chapter, when introducing tokens we discuss the colloquial meaning of token as "something of insignificant value". The underlying reason for the insignificant value of most tokens is because they can only be used in a very narrow context: one bus company, one laundromat, one arcade, one hotel, one company store. Limited liquidity, limited applicability and high conversion costs reduce the value of tokens, all the way down until it is only a "token" value. So when you add a utility token to your platform, but the token can only be used on your own one platform with a small market, you are re-creating the conditions that made physical tokens worthless. If in order to use your platform, a user has to convert something into your utility token, use it and then convert the remainder back into something more generally useful, you've created company scrip. The switching costs of a digital token are orders of magnitude lower than a physical token without a market. But the switching costs are not zero. Utility tokens that work across an entire industry sector will be very interesting and probably quite valuable. But if you set up your startup to have to bootstrap an entire industry standard in order to succeed, you may have already failed.

Make this decision for the right reasons. Adopt a token because your application _cannot work without a token_ (e.g. Ethereum). Adopt it because the token solves a fundamental market barrier or access problem. Don't introduce a utility token because it is the only way you can raise money fast and you need to pretend it's not a public securities offering. 

=== Token Standards

Blockchain tokens have existed before Ethereum. In some ways, the first blockchain currency, bitcoin, is a token itself. Many token platforms were also developed on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before Ethereum. However, the introduction of the first token standard on Ethereum led to an explosion of tokens.

Vitalik Buterin suggested tokens as one of the most obvious and useful applications of a generalized programmable blockchain such as Ethereum. In fact, in the first year of Ethereum it was common to see Vitalik and others wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the Ethereum logo and a smart contract sample on the back. There were several variations of this t-shirt, but the most common showed an implementation of a token.

==== ERC20 Token Standard

The first standard was introduced in November 2015 by Fabian Vogelsteller, as an Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC). It was automatically assigned GitHub issue number 20, giving rise to the name "ERC20 token". The vast majority of tokens are currently based on ERC20. The ERC20 request for comments, eventually became Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP20, but is mostly still referred to by the original name ERC20. You can read the standard here:

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md

ERC20 is a standard for _fungible tokens_ meaning that different units of an ERC20 token are interchangeable and have no unique properties.

The ERC20 standard defines a common interface for contracts implementing a token, such that any compatible token can be accessed and used in the same way. The interface consists of a number of functions that must be present in every implementation of the standard, as well as some optional functions and attributes that may be added by developers.

===== ERC20 required functions & events

totalSupply:: Returns the total units of this token that currently exist. ERC20 tokens can have fixed or variable supply.

balanceOf:: Given an address, returns the token balance of that address.

transfer:: Given an address and amount, transfers that amount of tokens to that address, from the balance of the address that executed the transfer.

transferFrom:: Given a sender, recipient and amount, transfers tokens from one account to another. Used in combination with +approve+ below.

approve:: Given a recipient address and amount, authorizes that address to execute several transfers up to that amount, from the account that issued the approval.

allowance:: Given an owner address and a spender address, returns the remaining amount that the spender is approved to withdraw from the owner.

Transfer event:: Event triggered upon successful transfer (call to +transfer+ or +transferFrom+) (even for zero value transfers).

Approval event:: Event logged upon successful call to +approve+.

===== ERC20 optional functions

name:: Returns a human readable name (e.g. "US Dollars") of the token.

symbol:: Returns a human readable symbol (e.g. "USD") for the token.

decimals:: Returns the number of decimals used to divide token amounts. For example, if decimals is 2, then the token amount is divided by 100 to get its user representation.

===== The ERC20 interface defined in Solidity

Here's what an ERC20 interface specification looks like in Solidity:

----
contract ERC20 {
   function totalSupply() constant returns (uint theTotalSupply);
   function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint balance);
   function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
   function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success);
   function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool success);
   function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint remaining);
   event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
   event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);
}
----

===== ERC20 data structures

If you examine any ERC20 implementation, it will contain two data structures, one to track balances and one to track allowances. In Solidity, they are implemented with a _data mapping_.

The first data mapping implements an internal table of token balances, by owner. This allows the token contract to keep track of who owns the tokens. Each transfer is a deduction from one balance and an addition to another balance.

.Balances: a mapping from address (owner) to amount (balance)
----
mapping(address => uint256) balances;
----

The second data structure is a data mapping of allowances. As we will see in <<transfer_workflows>>, with ERC20 tokens an owner of a token can delegate authority to a spender, allowing them to spend a specific amount (allowance) from the owner's balance. The ERC20 contract keeps track of the allowances with a two-dimensional mapping, with the primary key being the address of the token owner, mapping to a spender address and an allowance amount:

.Allowances: a mapping from address (owner) to address (spender) to amount (allowance)
----
mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowed;
----


[[transfer_workflows]]
===== ERC20 workflows: "transfer" and "approve & transferFrom"

The ERC20 token standard has two transfer functions. You might be wondering why?

ERC20 allows two different workflows. The first is a single-transaction, straightforward workflow using the +transfer+ function. This workflow is the one used by wallets to send tokens to other wallets. The vast majority of token transactions happen with the +transfer+ workflow.

Executing the transfer contract is very simple. If Alice wants to send an 10 tokens to Bob, her wallet sends a transaction to the token contract's address, calling the +transfer+ function with Bob's address and "10" as the arguments. The token contract adjusts Alice's balance (-10) and Bob's balance (+10) and issues a +Transfer+ event.

The second workflow is a two-transaction workflow that uses +approve+, followed by +transferFrom+. This workflow allows a token owner to delegate their control to another address. It is most often used to delegate control to a contract for distribution of tokens, but it can also be used by exchanges. For example, if a company is selling tokens for an ICO, they can +approve+ a crowdsale contract address to distribute a certain amount of tokens. The crowdsale contract can then +transferFrom+ the token contract owner balance to each buyer of the token.

[[approve_transferFrom_workflow]]
.The two-step approve & transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens
image::images/approve_transferFrom_workflow.png["The two-step approve & transferFrom workflow of ERC20 tokens"]

For the +approve & transferFrom+ workflow, two transactions are needed. Let's say that Alice wants to allow the AliceICO contract to sell 50% of all the AliceCoin tokens to buyers like Bob and Charlie. First, Alice launches the AliceCoin ERC20 contract, issuing all the AliceCoin to her own address. Then, Alice launches the AliceICO contract that can sell tokens for ether. Next, Alice initiates the +approve & transferFrom+ workflow. She sends a transaction to AliceCoin, calling +approve+, with the address of AliceICO and 50% of the +totalSupply+. This will trigger the +Approval+ event. Now, the AliceICO contract can sell AliceCoin. When AliceICO receives ether from Bob, it needs to send some AliceCoin to Bob in return. To do that, AliceICO calls the AliceCoin +transferFrom+ function, with Alice's address as the sender, Bob's address as the recipient and the amount of tokens to give Bob. The AliceCoin contract transfers the balance from Alice's address to Bob's address and triggers a +Transfer+ event. The AliceICO contract can call +transferFrom+ an unlimited number of times, as long as it doesn't exceed the approval limit Alice set. The AliceICO contract can keep track of how many AliceCoin tokens it can sell by calling the +allowance+ function.

===== ERC20 Implementations

While it is possible to implement an ERC20-compatible token in about thirty lines of Solidity code, most implementations are more complex, to account for potential security vulnerabilities. There are two implementations mentioned in the EIP20 standard:

Consensys EIP20:: A simple and easy to read implementation of an ERC20-compatible token.

You can read the Solidity code for Consensys' implementation here:
https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol

OpenZeppelin StandardToken:: This implementation is ERC20-compatible, with additional security precautions. It forms the basis of OpenZeppelin libraries implementing more complex ERC20-compatible tokens with fundraising caps, auctions, vesting schedules and other features.

You can see the Solidity code for OpenZeppelin StandardToken here:
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol

[[metoken_example]]
==== Launching our own ERC20 token

Let's create and launch our own token. For this example, we will use the +truffle+ framework (see <<truffle>>). The example assumes you have already installed +truffle+, configured it, and are familiar with its basic operation.

We will call our token "Mastering Ethereum Token", with symbol "MET".

You can find this example in the book's GitHub repository:
https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/first_edition/code/METoken

First, let's create and initialize a truffle project directory, the same way we did in <<truffle_project_directory>>. Run these four commands and accept the default answers to any questions:

----
$ mkdir METoken
$ cd METoken
METoken $ truffle init
METoken $ npm init
----

You should now have the following directory structure:

----
METoken/
├── contracts
│   └── Migrations.sol
├── migrations
│   └── 1_initial_migration.js
├── package.json
├── test
├── truffle-config.js
└── truffle.js
----

Edit the +truffle.js+ configuration file to setup your +truffle+ environment, or copy the one we used from:

https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/first_edition/code/Faucet/truffle.js

If you use the example +truffle.js+, remember to create a file +.env+ in the +METoken+ folder containing your test private keys for testing and deployment on public Ethereum test networks, such as ganache or Kovan. You can export your test network private key from MetaMask.

[WARNING]
====
Only use test keys or test mnemonics that are not used to hold funds on the main Ethereum network. Never use keys that hold real money for testing.
====

For our example, we will import the OpenZeppelin StandardContract, which implements some important security checks and is easy to extend. Let's import that library:

----
$ npm install zeppelin-solidity

+ zeppelin-solidity@1.6.0
added 8 packages in 2.504s
----

The +zeppelin-solidity+ package will add about 250 files under the +node_modules+ directory. The OpenZeppelin library includes a lot more than the ERC20 token, but we will only use a small part of it.

Next, let's write our token contract. Create a new file +METoken.sol+ and copy the example code from GitHub:

https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/first_edition/code/METoken/contracts/METoken.sol

Our contract is very simple, as it inherits all the functionality from the OpenZeppelin StandardToken library:

[[solidity_token_example]]
.METoken.sol : A Solidity contract implementing an ERC20 token
[source,solidity,linenums]
----
include::code/METoken/contracts/METoken.sol[]
----

Here, we are defining the optional variables +name+, +symbol+, and +decimals+. We also define an +_initial_supply+ variable, set to 21 million tokens, and two decimals of subdivision (2.1 billion total). In the contract's initialization (constructor) function we set the +totalSupply+ to be equal to +_initial_supply+ and allocate all of the +_initial_supply+ to the balance of the account (+msg.sender+) that creates the +METoken+ contract.

We now use +truffle+ to compile the +METoken+ code:

----
$ truffle compile
Compiling ./contracts/METoken.sol...
Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.sol...
Compiling zeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol...
Compiling zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/BasicToken.sol...
Compiling zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol...
Compiling zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Basic.sol...
Compiling zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol...

----

As you can see, +truffle+ incorporated necessary dependencies from the OpenZeppelin libraries and compiled those contracts too.

Let's set up a migration script, to deploy the +METoken+ contract. Create a new file +2_deploy_contracts.js+ in the +METoken/migrations+ folder. Copy the contents from the example on Github repository:

https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/first_edition/code/METoken/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js

Here's what it contains:

[[metoken_migration]]
.2_deploy_contracts: Migration to deploy METoken
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::code/METoken/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js[]
----

Before we deploy on one of the Ethereum test networks, let's start a local blockchain to test everything. Start the +ganache+ blockchain, either from the command-line with +ganache-cli+ or from the graphical user interface, as we did in <<using_ganache>>.

Once +ganache+ is started, we can deploy our METoken contract and see if everything works as expected:

----
$ truffle migrate --network ganache

On the +ganache+ console, we should see that our deployment has created 4 new transactions:

====使用truffle console与METoken进行交互

我们可以使用truffle console与ganache区块链的合约进行交互。这是一个交互式的JavaScript环境，它提供了对truffle环境的访问，并通过Web3向区块链提供了访问。在这种情况下，我们将truffle console连接到ganache区块链:

----
$ truffle console --network ganache
truffle(ganache)>
----

truffle(ganache)>表示我们已经连接到ganache区块链，并准备好输入命令。truffle console支持所有的truffle命令，因此我们可以从console中进行编译(compile)和迁移(migrate)。我们已经运行了这些命令，直接进入合约。在truffle环境中，METoken合约作为一个JavaScript对象存在。在提示符处输入METoken，它将转储整个合约的定义:

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken
{ [Function: TruffleContract]
  _static_methods:

[...]

currentProvider:
 HttpProvider {
   host: 'http://localhost:7545',
   timeout: 0,
   user: undefined,
   password: undefined,
   headers: undefined,
   send: [Function],
   sendAsync: [Function],
   _alreadyWrapped: true },
network_id: '5777' }

----

METoken还公开了几个属性，例如合约的地址（由转移命令(migrate)部署）：

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken.address
'0x345ca3e014aaf5dca488057592ee47305d9b3e10'
----

如果我们想要与已部署的合约进行交互，必须用JavaScript语言“promise”的形式进行异步调用。 我们用deployed函数来获取合约实例，然后调用totalSupply函数：

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => instance.totalSupply())
BigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2100000000 ] }
----

接下来，让我们使用由ganache创建的账户来检查我们的METoken余额并将一些METoken发送到另一个地址。 首先，让我们获取帐户地址：

----
truffle(ganache)> let accounts
undefined
truffle(ganache)> web3.eth.getAccounts((err,res) => { accounts = res })
undefined
truffle(ganache)> accounts[0]
'0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57'

----

帐户列表现在包含由ganache创建的所有帐户，以及账户[0]是部署了该METoken合约的帐户。 它应该有一个METoken的balance，因为METoken构造函数将整个令牌提供给创建它的地址。 让我们核对：

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]).then(console.log) })
undefined
BigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2100000000 ] }
----

最后，让我们调用合约的传递函数，将1000.00 METoken从帐户[0]转移到帐户[1]：

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.transfer(accounts[1], 100000) })
undefined
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]).then(console.log) })
undefined
truffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 9, c: [ 2099900000 ] }

undefined
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.balanceOf(accounts[1]).then(console.log) })
undefined
truffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 5, c: [ 100000 ] }

----

[TIP]
====
METoken具有2位精度的小数，这意味着1个METoken在合约中是100个单位。 当我们转移1000个METoken时，我们在传递函数中将该值指定为100,000。
====

正如你所见，在console中，帐户[0]现在拥有20,999,000 MET，帐户[1]拥有1000 MET。

如果你切换到ganache图形用户界面，您将看到称为传递函数（transfer function）的记录：

[[ganache_metoken_transfer]]
.METoken transfer on Ganache
image::images/ganache_metoken_transfer.png["METoken在Ganache中的传递"]


====发送ERC20代币到合约地址

到目前为止，我们已经设置了ERC20令牌并从一个帐户转移到另一个帐户。 我们用于这些示范的所有账户都是外部拥有账户（EOAs），这意味着它们由私钥控制，而不是合约。 如果我们将MET发送到合约地址会发生什么？ 让我们一起发现！

首先，我们将其他合约部署到我们的测试环境中。 对于这个例子，我们将使用我们的第一份合约Faucet.sol。 我们将它添加到METoken项目中，方法是将其复制到合约目录中。 我们的目录应该是这样的：

----
METoken/
├── contracts
│   ├── Faucet.sol
│   ├── METoken.sol
│   └── Migrations.sol
----

我们也添加了一个migration, 以便将Faucet和METoken分离：

----
var Faucet = artifacts.require("Faucet");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  // Deploy the Faucet contract as our only task
  deployer.deploy(Faucet);
};
----

让我们在truffle console中编译(compile)和传递(migrate)合约。

----
$ truffle console --network ganache
truffle(ganache)> compile
Compiling ./contracts/Faucet.sol...
Writing artifacts to ./build/contracts

truffle(ganache)> migrate

太棒了！现在让我们发送一些MET到Faucet合约吧：

----
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.transfer(Faucet.address, 100000) })
truffle(ganache)> METoken.deployed().then(instance => { instance.balanceOf(Faucet.address).then(console.log)})
truffle(ganache)> BigNumber { s: 1, e: 5, c: [ 100000 ] }
----

好了，我们已经把1000个MET转移到Faucet合约上了。现在，我们怎么从Faucet上提取这些MET呢？

请牢记，Faucet.sol是一个非常简单的合约。它只有一个功能，那就是提取以太（ether）。它并没有一个提取MET或者其他任何ERC20 代币的功能。如果我们让它行使提取（非以太）的动作，它会尝试发送以太，但由于faucet不会达到以太的平衡，这个动作将会失败。
 METoken合约确知Faucet有余额，但它唯一能转移余额的方式是接收到来自合约地址的转账命令。 不管怎样，我们需要让Faucet合约调用METoken的传递函数。

如果你想知道下一步该做什么的话，就别想了。 这个问题没有解决办法。 发送到Faucet的MET卡住了，永久的。 只有Faucet合约才能转移它，Faucet合约没有代码来调用ERC20代币合约的传递函数。

也许你预料到了这个问题， 但很大可能是你并没有。 实际上，数百名以太坊用户也无意将各种代币转移到没有任何ERC20能力的合约上。 据估计，价值超过250万美元的代币像这样被“卡住”，并且永远丢失。

ERC20代币的用户在转移代币时无意中丢失代币的方式之一是他们尝试转移到具有交易或其他服务的地方。 他们从交易所网站复制了以太坊地址，认为只需发送代币即可。 但是，许多交易所实际上公布的都是合约的收货地址！ 这些合约具有许多不同的功能，通常将所有发送给他们的资金都清扫到“冷库”或其他集中的钱包。 尽管有许多警告说“不要将代币发送到这个地址”，但依然有许多代币以这种方式丢失。

==== 演示批准（approve）和转让（transferForm）的工作流程

我们的Faucet合约无法处理ERC20代币，使用传递函数向它发送代币会导致这些代币丢失。 我们重写合约，并让它能处理ERC20代币。 具体而言，我们将把它变成一个可以把MET发给任何访问者的faucet。

在这个例子中，我们制作了一个truffle程序目录的副本，称之为METoken_METFaucet，初始化 truffle，npm，安装OpenZeppelin相关项并复制METoken.sol合约。 请参阅我们的第一个示例 Launching our own ERC20 token，已有详细说明。

现在，让我们创建一个新的faucet合约，称之为METFaucet.sol.看起来像这样：METFaucet.sol: 一份为了METoken的faucet合约。

[[METFaucet]]
.METFaucet.sol: a faucet for METoken
[source,solidity,linenums]
----
include::code/METoken_METFaucet/contracts/METFaucet.sol
----

我们对基本的faucet样本做了一些改变。 由于METFaucet将使用METoken中的transferFrom函数，因此它需要两个额外的变量。 一个将保存已部署METoken合约的地址。 另一个将保存允许faucet提款的MET所有者的地址。 METFaucet将调用METoken.transferFrom并指示它将MET从所有者处移至faucet中收到提取请求的地址。

我们在这里声明这两个变量：
----
StandardToken public METoken;
address public METOwner;
----

由于faucet需要使用METoken和METOwner的正确地址进行初始化，因此我们需要声明一个自定义构造函数：

----
// METFaucet constructor, provide the address of METoken contract and
// the owner address we will be approved to transferFrom
function METFaucet(address _METoken, address _METOwner) public {

	// Initialize the METoken from the address provided
	METoken = StandardToken(_METoken);
	METOwner = _METOwner;
}
----

下一个改变是提取功能。 METFaucet使用METoken中的transferFrom函数而不是调用传递函数，并要求METoken将MET传递给faucet接收人：

----
// Use the transferFrom function of METoken
METoken.transferFrom(METOwner, msg.sender, withdraw_amount);
----

最后，由于faucet不再发送以太，所以我们应该可以防止任何人将以太发送到METFaucet，因为我们不希望它卡住。 我们更改回退应付功能以拒绝传入的以太网，并使用回复功能来还原所有收款：

----
// REJECT any incoming ether
function () public payable { revert(); }
----

现在METFaucet.sol代码已准备就绪，我们需要修改迁移脚本来部署它。 这个迁移脚本会更复杂一点，因为METFaucet依赖于METoken的地址。 我们将使用JavaScript承诺按顺序部署这两个合约。 创建2_deply_contracts.js，如下所示：

----
var METoken = artifacts.require("METoken");
var METFaucet = artifacts.require("METFaucet");
var owner = web3.eth.accounts[0];

module.exports = function(deployer) {

	// Deploy the METoken contract first
	deployer.deploy(METoken, {from: owner}).then(function() {
		// then deploy METFaucet and pass the address of METoken
		// and the address of the owner of all the MET who will approve METFaucet
		return deployer.deploy(METFaucet, METoken.address, owner);
  	});
}
----

现在，我们可以测试truffle console中的所有内容。 首先，使用迁移函数来部署合约。 当METoken被部署时，它会将所有MET分配给创建它的帐户，web3.eth.accounts [0]。 然后，在METoken中调用批准函数来批准METFaucet发送高达1000 的MET，用web3.eth.accounts [0]表示。 最后，为了测试faucet，我们调用web3.eth.accounts [1]中的METFaucet.withdraw并尝试提取10 MET。 以下是控制台命令：

----
$ truffle console --network ganache
truffle(ganache)> migrate
Using network 'ganache'.

----

正如从结果所见，我们可以使用批准和转让工作流程来授权一个合约转移另一个代币中中定义的代币。 如果使用得当，ERC20代币可以由外部拥有的地址和其他合约使用。

然而这样正确管理ERC20代币的负担会推送到用户界面。 如果用户错误地尝试将ERC20代币转移到合约地址，并且该合约不能接收ERC20代币，则代币将丢失。

==== Issues with ERC20 tokens

The adoption of the ERC20 token standard has been truly explosive. Thousands of tokens have been launched, both to experiment with new capabilities and to raise funds in various "crowdfund" auctions and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). However there are some potential pitfalls, as we saw with the issue of transferring tokens to contract addresses.

ERC20 代币标准已经被极其广泛地采用。成千上万的代币发行即是为了实验新的特性也是为了通过众筹拍卖或 ICO 来融资。不过，正如我们看到，采用 ERC20 代币在将代币转移到合约地址时会有一些问题。

One of the less obvious issues with ERC20 tokens is that they expose subtle differences between tokens and ether itself. Where ether is transferred by a transaction which has a recipient address as its destination, token transfers occur within the _specific token contract state_ and have the token contract as their destination, not the recipient's address. The token contract tracks balances, and issues events. In a token transfer, no transaction is actually sent to the recipient of the token. Instead, the recipients address is added to a map within the token contract itself. A transaction sending ether to an address, changes the state of an address. A transaction transferring a token to an address, only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address. Even a wallet that has support for ERC20 tokens does not become aware of a token balance, unless the user explicitly adds a specific token contract to "watch". Some wallets watch the most popular token contracts to detect balances held by addresses they control, but that's limited to a small fraction of the available ERC20 contracts.

其中一个不太明显的问题是 ERC20 代币和以太(ether)本身是有细微差别的。以太的转移是靠一笔有收款人地址的交易(transaction)来完成，而代币的转移是在某个具体的代币合约里完成，其接收者是这个代币合约而不是一个收款人地址。代币合约会跟踪余额以及发布事件。在一次代币转移中，实际上没有一笔真正的交易发到代币的接收者那里，而是把收款人地址加到了代币合约中。一笔通常意义上发送以太到某个地址的交易是在改变那个地址的状态。一笔转移代币到某个地址的交易只更改了合约的状态而没有改变收款人地址的状态。即便是一个支持 ERC20 代币的钱包也不会变得能够知道代币余额，除非用户特地添加了个监控代币余额的合约。有些钱包会监听最热门的合约来获取用户所掌握的代币余额信息，但是这仅限于非常小部分的 ERC20 合约。

In fact, it's unlikely that a user would _want_ to track all balances in all possible ERC20 token contracts. Many ERC20 tokens are more like email spam than usable tokens. They automatically create balances for accounts that have ether activity, to attract users. If you have an Ethereum address with a long history of activity, especially if it was created in the presale, you will find it full of "junk" tokens that appeared out of nowhere. Of course, the address isn't really full of tokens, it's the token contracts that have your address in them. You only see these balances if these tokens contracts are being watched by the block explorer or wallet you use to view your address.

事实上，一个用户不太可能会想监听所有的代币合约里的代币余额。很多 ERC20 代币更像是垃圾邮件而不是有价值的代币。这些代币会为了吸引用户，自动为有以太活动的账户创建余额。如果你拥有一个有长期活动历史的以太坊地址，特别是如果这个地址是在预售期被创建的，你会发现这里面充满了不知道从哪冒出来的『垃圾』代币。当然，这些地址里不是真正地充满了代币，而是那些代币合约里有你的这些地址。你只有当你用区块链浏览器或者钱包去监听这些合约里你的地址时才会看到这些余额。

Tokens don't behave the same way as ether. Ether is sent with the +send+ function and accepted by any payable function in a contract or any externally owned address. Tokens are sent using +transfer+ or +approve & transferFrom+ functions that exist only in the ERC20 contract, and do not (at least in ERC20) trigger any payable functions in a recipient contract. Tokens are meant to function just like a cryptocurrency such as ether, but they come with certain subtle distinctions that break that illusion.

代币和以太的具体表现是不一样的。以太是通过发送函数(send function)进行发送并且可以被任意合约里的应付函数(payable function)或任意外部拥有账户(EOA)所接收。代币是通过只存在鱼 ERC20 合约里的 transfer 或者 approve & transferFrom 函数进行发送，并且至少在 ERC20 中并不会触发任何接收人合约的应付函数。代币的职能本来是应该和以太这样的加密货币一样，但是他们本身和以太一些细微的不同打破了这样的幻想。

Consider another issue. To send ether, or use any Ethereum contract you need ether to pay gas. To send tokens, you _also need ether_. You cannot pay for a transaction's gas with a token and the token contract can't pay the gas for you. This can cause some rather strange user experiences. For example, let's say you use an exchange or Shapeshift to convert some bitcoin to a token. You "receive" the token in a wallet that tracks that token's contract and shows your balance. It looks the same as any of the other cryptocurrencies you have in your wallet. Now try sending the token and your wallet will inform you that you need ether to do that. You might be confused - after all you didn't need ether to receive the token. Perhaps you have no ether. Perhaps you didn't even know the token was an ERC20 token on Ethereum, maybe you thought it was a cryptocurrency with its own blockchain. The illusion just broke.

现在我们来看另一个问题。想要给别人转以太或者使用以太坊合约，你需要以太来支付相应的交易工作量(gas)。想要给别人转代币，你同样需要以太。你无法用代币来支付一笔交易所需的计算工作量，你的代币合约也同样无法为你支付所需的计算工作量。这就会导致一些非常奇怪的用户体验。打比方说你用某个交易所把一些比特币换成了某种代币。你『接收』到了这些代币并且用钱包监听了这个代币的合约以显示你的余额。这跟你在钱包里拥有的其他加密货币看起没有什么不同。但是如果你现在想要把这些代币转出去，你的钱包就会提醒你说你需要有以太才能转账。你可能会觉得非常奇怪，毕竟你接收这些代币的时候都没有需要用到以太。你可能没有以太。你可能根本就不知道这个代币是基于以太坊 ERC20 的一种代币，你可能还觉得它是一种拥有自己区块链的加密货币。不管怎样，这样的臆想在你转不出去账的时候破灭了。

Some of these issues are specific to ERC20 tokens. Others are more general issues that relate to abstraction and interface boundaries within Ethereum. Some can be solved by changing the token interface, others may need changes to fundamental structures within Ethereum (such as the distinction between EOAs and contracts, and between transactions and messages). Some may not be "solvable" exactly and may require user interface design to hide the nuances and make the user experience consistent regardless of the underlying distinctions.

有些问题是针对于 ERC20 代币的，而其他的是更宽泛的、跟以太坊抽象和接口边界有关的问题。有些问题能通过修改代币接口解决，有的可能需要改变以太坊的基础架构（比如外部拥有账户(EOA)和合约(contract)之间的差异，交易(transaction)和消息(message)之间的差异）。有些差异可能并不能被消除，它们需要通过一些用户界面的隐藏使得用户感知不到内部的细微差异。

In the next sections we will look at various proposals that attempt to address some of these issues.

在下面一个章节我们将会介绍一些想要解决以上部分问题的提案。

==== ERC223 - a proposed token contract interface standard

The ERC223 proposal attempts to solve the problem of inadvertent transfer of tokens to a contract (that may or may not support tokens) by detecting whether the destination address is a contract or not. ERC223 requires that contracts designed to accept tokens implement a function named +tokenFallback+. If the destination of a transfer is a contract and the contract does not have support for tokens (i.e. does not implement +tokenFallback+), the transfer fails.

To detect whether the destination address is a contract, the ERC223 reference implementation uses a small segment of inline bytecode, in a rather creative way:

----
function isContract(address _addr) private view returns (bool is_contract) {
	uint length;
	assembly {
		  //retrieve the size of the code on target address, this needs assembly
		  length := extcodesize(_addr)
	}
	return (length>0);
}
----

You can see the discussion around the ERC223 proposal here:

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223

The ERC223 contract interface specification is:

[source,solidity]
----
interface ERC223Token {
  uint public totalSupply;
  function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint);

  function name() public view returns (string _name);
  function symbol() public view returns (string _symbol);
  function decimals() public view returns (uint8 _decimals);
  function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 _supply);

  function transfer(address to, uint value) public returns (bool ok);
  function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data) public returns (bool ok);
  function transfer(address to, uint value, bytes data, string custom_fallback) public returns (bool ok);

  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value, bytes indexed data);
}
----

ERC223 is not widely implemented and there is some debate in the ERC discussion thread about backwards compatibility and trade-offs between implementing changes at the contract interface level versus the user interface. The debate continues.

==== ERC777 - a proposed token contract interface standard

Another proposal for an improved token contract standard is ERC777. This proposal has several goals, including:

* To offer an ERC20 compatibility interface
* To transfer tokens using a +send+ function, similar to ether transfers
* To be compatible with ERC820 for token contract registration
* Contracts and addresses can control which tokens they send through a +tokensToSend+ function that is called prior to sending
* Contracts and addresses are notified by calling a +tokensReceived+ function in the recipient
* Token transfer transactions contain metadata in a +userData+ and +operatorData+ field
* To operate in the same way, whether sending to a contract or EOA

The details and ongoing discussion on ERC777 can be found here:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/777

The ERC777 contract interface specification is:

[source,solidity]
----
interface ERC777Token {
    function name() public constant returns (string);
    function symbol() public constant returns (string);
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256);
    function granularity() public constant returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) public constant returns (uint256);

    function send(address to, uint256 amount) public;
    function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData) public;

    function authorizeOperator(address operator) public;
    function revokeOperator(address operator) public;
    function isOperatorFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) public constant returns (bool);
    function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) public;

    event Sent(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData);
    event Minted(address indexed operator, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bytes operatorData);
    event Burned(address indexed operator, address indexed from, uint256 amount, bytes userData, bytes operatorData);
    event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
}
----

A reference implementation of ERC777 is linked in the proposal. ERC777 depends on a parallel proposal for a registry contract, specified in ERC820. Some of the debate on ERC777 is about the complexity of adopting two big changes at once: a new token standard and a registry standard. The discussion continues.

==== ERC721 - non-fungible token (deed) standard

All the token standards we have looked at so far are _fungible_ tokens, meaning that each unit of a token is entirely interchangeable. The ERC20 token standard only tracks the final balance of each account and does not (explicitly) track the provenance of any token.

The ERC721 proposal is for a standard for _non-fungible_ tokens, also known as _deeds_.

From the Oxford Dictionary:

    deed: A legal document that is signed and delivered, especially one regarding the ownership of property or legal rights.

The use of the word deed is intended to reflect the "ownership of property" part, even though these are not recognized as "legal documents" in any jurisdiction, at least not currently.

Non-fungible tokens track ownership of a unique thing. The thing owned can be a digital item, such as a game item, or digital collectible. Or, the thing can be a physical item whose ownership is tracked by a token, such as a house, a car, artwork. A deed could also represent things with negative value, such as loans (debt), liens, easements, etc. The ERC721 standard places no limitation or expectation on the nature of the thing whose ownership is tracked by a deed, only that it can be uniquely identified, which in the case of this standard is achieved by a 256-bit identifier.

The details of the standard and discussion are tracked in two different GitHub locations:

Initial proposal:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721

Continued discussion:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/841

To grasp the basic difference between ERC20 and ERC721, it is sufficient to look at the internal data structure used in ERC721:

[source,solidity]
----
// Mapping from deed ID to owner
mapping (uint256 => address) private deedOwner;
----

Whereas ERC20 tracks the balances that belong to each owner, with the owner being the primary key of the mapping, ERC721 tracks each deed ID and who owns it, with the deed ID being the primary key of the mapping. From this basic difference flow all the properties of a non-fungible token.

The ERC721 contract interface specification is:

[source,solidity]
----
interface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _deedId);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 _deedId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 _balance);
    function ownerOf(uint256 _deedId) external view returns (address _owner);
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _deedId) external payable;
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _deedId) external payable;
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _deedId) external payable;
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operateor, boolean _approved) payable;
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
}
----

ERC721 also supports two _*optional*_ interfaces, one for metadata and one for enumeration of deeds and owners.

The ERC721 optional interface for metadata is:

[source,solidity]
----
interface ERC721Metadata /* is ERC721 */ {
    function name() external pure returns (string _name);
    function symbol() external pure returns (string _symbol);
    function deedUri(uint256 _deedId) external view returns (string _deedUri);
}
----

The ERC721 optional interface for enumeration is:

[source,solidity]
----
interface ERC721Enumerable /* is ERC721 */ {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256 _count);
    function deedByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256 _deedId);
    function countOfOwners() external view returns (uint256 _count);
    function ownerByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (address _owner);
    function deedOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256 _deedId);
}
----

=== Token standards

In this section we've reviewed several proposed standards, and a couple of widely-deployed standards for token contracts. What exactly do these standards do? Should you use these standards? How should you use them? Should you add functionality beyond these standards? Which standards should you use? We will examine all those questions next.

==== What are token standards? What is their purpose?

Token standards are a _minimum_ specification for an implementation. What that means is that in order to be compliant with, say ERC20, you need to, at-minimum, implement the functions and behavior specified by ERC20. You are also free to _add_ to the functionality by implementing functions that are not part of the standard.

The primary purpose of these standards is to encourage _interoperability_ between contracts. Thus, all wallets, exchanges, user interfaces and other infrastructure components can _interface_ in a predictable manner with any contract that follows the specification.

The standards are meant to be _descriptive_, rather than _prescriptive_. How you choose to implement those functions is up to you - the internal function of the contract is not relevant to the standard. They have some functional requirements, which govern the behavior under specific circumstances, but they do not prescribe an implementation. An example of this is the behavior of a transfer function if the value is set to zero.

==== Should you use these standards?

Given all these standards, each developer faces a dilemma: use the existing standards or innovate beyond the restrictions they impose?

This dilemma is not easy to resolve. Standards necessarily restrict your ability to innovate, by creating a narrow "rut" that you have to follow. On the other hand, the basic standards have emerged from experience with hundreds of applications and often fit well with 99% of the use-cases.

As part of this consideration is an even bigger issue: the value of interoperability and broad adoption. If you choose to use an existing standard, you gain the value of all the systems designed to work with that standard. If you choose to depart from the standard, you have to consider the cost of building all of the support infrastructure on your own, or persuading others to support your implementation as a new standard. The tendency to forge your own path and ignore existing standards is known as "Not Invented Here" and is antithetical to the open source culture. On the other hand, progress and innovation depends on departing from tradition sometimes. It's a tricky choice, so consider it carefully!

.Wikipedia "Not Invented Here" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)
 Not invented here is a stance adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures that avoid using or buying already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins and costs, such as royalties.

=== Security by maturity

Beyond the choice of standard, there is the parallel choice of _implementation_. When you decide to use a standard, such as ERC20, you have to then decide how to implement a compatible token. There are a number of existing "reference" implementations that are broadly used in the Ethereum ecosystem. Or you could write your own from scratch. Again, this choice represents a dilemma that can have serious security implications.

Existing implementations are "battle tested". While it is impossible to prove that they are secure, many of them underpin millions of dollars of tokens. They have been attacked, repeatedly and vigorously. So far, no significant vulnerabilities have been discovered. Writing your own is not easy - there are many subtle ways that a contract can be compromised. It is much safer to use a well-tested broadly-used implementation. In our examples above, we used the OpenZeppelin implementation of the ERC20 standard, as this implementation is security focused from the ground up.

If you use an existing implementation you can also extend it. Again, be careful with this impulse. Complexity is the enemy of security. Every single line of code you add expands the _attack surface_ of your contract and could represent a vulnerability lying in wait. You may not notice a problem until you put a lot of value on top of the contract and someone breaks it.

=== Extensions to token interface standards

The token standards discussed in this section start with a very minimal interface, with limited functionality. Many projects have created extended implementations, to support features that they need for their application. Some of these include:

Owner Control:: Specific addresses, or set of addresses (multi-signature) are given special capabilities, such as blacklisting, whitelisting, minting, recovery etc.

Burning:: A token burn is when tokens are deliberately destroyed by transfer to an unspendable address or by erasing a balance and reducing the supply.

Minting:: The ability to add to the total supply of tokens, at a predictable rate, or by "fiat" of the creator of the token.

Crowdfunding:: The ability to offer tokens for sale, for example through an auction, market sale, reverse-auction, etc.

Caps:: Pre-defined and immutable limits on the total supply, the opposite of the "minting" feature.

Recovery "Back Doors":: Functions to recover funds, reverse transfers, or dismantle the token that can be activated by a designated address or set of addresses (multi-signature).

Whitelisting:: The ability to restrict token transfers only to listed addresses. Most commonly used to offer tokens to "accredited investors" after vetting by the rules of different jurisdictions. There is usually a mechanism for updating the whitelist.

Blacklisting:: The ability to restrict token transfers by disallowing specific addresses. There is usually a function for updating the blacklist.

There are some reference implementations for many of these functions, for example in the OpenZeppelin library. Some of these are use-case specific and only implemented in a few tokens. There are, as of now, no widely accepted standards for the interfaces to these functions.

As previously discussed, the decision to extend a token standard with additional functionality represents a tradeoff between innovation/risk and interoperability/security.

=== Tokens and ICOs

Tokens have become an explosive development in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is likely that they will be a very important, foundational, component of all smart-contract platforms like Ethereum.

Nevertheless, the importance and future impact of these standards should not be confused with an endorsement of the current token offerings. As in any early stage technology, the first wave of products and companies will almost all fail, and some will fail spectacularly. Many of the tokens on offer in Ethereum today are barely disguised scams, pyramid schemes and money grabs.

Both can be true at the same time. The token standards and platform will survive the current token mania, and then they will likely change the world.
